Fish Boxing DevLog

DAY 1 (05-08-23)
---------
Today I spent all day working on brainstorming for an idea. I got the
idea of Fish Boxing from the game that's been taking over TikTok called
Shadow Boxing or Ish. I combined the two names to create Ish Boxing, and
realized that if I add an "F" to "ish" then I get Fish Boxing. Thus, the
concept was born. 

I really wanted to create something this summer so this is intended to be
solely a week long project. But we'll see how far I get with this.

Day 2 (05-09-23)
---------
Today I worked all day, but during that time I was able to start creating assets
in Aseprite to throw into the game. This is first time I genuinely started learning
how to use the Love2D framework and Lua without the guidance of a tutorial, and it
was a fun process just going through the documentation of Lua and Love2D.

By the end of the day, I had a rough concept of the game logic set in place and threw
in the assets I had made of the player, opponent, ui, and fish. I need to clean
the game logic so it can work properly, but I'm very happy with the development
so far.

Day 3 (05-10-23)
---------
Today I worked all day again, and during this time I continued to work on the game
logic to further match my vision of how the game is supposed to be played and overall
it's coming together very nicely. I was also able to create a end scene for when the player
wins (but for now it's when either player or opponent wins) and it works

After work, I came home and created sound effects and started messing around with the music,
audio, and video playing. I was memeing around a little bit with audio which was very fun and
allowed me to goof off with the process of development for a bit.

I also uploaded the project to my GitHub today!
